# Awesome Demogame: The Binding Of Krishna #

The awesome demogame The Binding of Krishna is being developed using the [Pocket Code](https://catrob.at/pc) app in the [Catrobat](https://www.catrobat.org/) language. 

This project was started in 2019 as a [Google summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) project.

Special thanks to Edmund McMillen for letting us base The Binding of Krishna on ideas from his awesome game The Binding of Isaac (Â© McMillen Games Inc.)
